### Base requirement group
* Adrian, Grayson, Robert
  
  Both of my team members gave their good and honest effort
  We traded with each other ideas and approaches, such as
  what worked and what didn't. We had rough start figuring out
  how to sort by time as different feeds had different time zones.
  We really only interected in class but did not meet up. I can't
  recall seeing Grayson the next 2 class meetings but Robert
  and I tried to break down the logic and explaining
  the python code to each other to see if we understood the steps.
