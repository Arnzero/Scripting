Dear diary,
    I decided to tackle the minimum bar for this assignment of grabbing 2 url's 
    and sorting the articles of the 2 sources based on their time. To preface 
    the rest, I had web apps and computer security exam so I wasn't able to fully 
    immerse and  explore stretch ideas. I tried to write the entries into a CSV but 
    got lost converting a type datetime to string, I saw a website grabbing
    timestamps but what I couldn't get my project to convert so it only creates
    the CSV and leaves it blank. I do want to try some stuff with selenium later
    and beautiful but I can't get too ambitious to keep my work/life balanced.
    The fun aspect of the assignment was putting break points on the code and seeing
    how a single post is an aggregate of many values. RSS has a nice general
    structure making it easier to find specific values that people might find
    useful. Familiarizing myself with pythons potentials using libraries takes
    some time because there are libraries that will do all the hardwork but
    some features are too specific and have to be written using less abstract 
    code. It can be a bit of a challenge trying to find a resource on google that
    resembles what I'm intending to do, most of the time it is very similar
    and but most of the primitive stuff has many resources. If I could make a
    project with selenium with different operations such as log into HSU canvas
    and go to the homework section or lecture notes. For beautiful soup I would
    have a webscrapper make files once a week for a list of top 10 most played songs
    using a specific website then use selenium to log into my google account and
    search and find these songs and add them to my watch later playlist. Then when
    I am on the road I can listen to the trendy songs of the week. I would have
    different categories depending on where the data was gained such as, top ten
    in sweden, in japan etc. but I wouldn't be surprised if these internet links
    mis-under-represent the actual trendy songs and I end up listening to top
    music from the western part of USA.
